* To create a new container and get it's ID in a shell script:

	CID=$(docker create nginx:latest)
	echo $CID

* Linking containers
* Read only filesystems and volumes
* Use init or supervisor in the container (to restart processes if they crash)
	* How does this compare with the docker --restart flag?

To search for docker images use:

	docker search <docker image>

* Mount volumes to share data outside of the container
* Volumes can be read-only to the container
* Problems:
	* Tie otherwie portable containers to the filesystem of a specific host
	* Multiple containers could compete for the same set of files

* Docker-managed columes
	* Not exactly sure how this works with OSX.
	  I can't find the folder on the host system

* To copy managed volumes between containers use:

	--columes-from <container>

* Remove all containers with:

	docker rm -v $(docker ps -aq)

* Volume containers are only provide a handle to volumes
	* Like for database data (so you can do super simple updates)

* Data-packed volume containers for configuration

* Use volumes to create polymorphic containers
	* Environment settings
	* Debug tools
	* Etc

* CH 12 has multi-host docker info
